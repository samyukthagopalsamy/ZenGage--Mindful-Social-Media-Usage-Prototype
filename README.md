## Inspiration
Our inspiration for ZenGage came from observing the increasing number of people who are addicted to social media. We noticed that many people spend hours scrolling through their feeds, leading to feelings of anxiety and stress. We were inspired to create ZenGage because we recognized that current existing solutions for tracking social media usage often lack features that promote mindfulness and help users understand the impact of their usage on their well-being. Simply tracking the time spent on social media platforms and sending pop-up notifications after a set amount of time is not effective, as users can simply snooze or ignore these notifications when they are engrossed in something interesting.

## What it does
ZenGage takes a different approach by allowing the personalization of mindfulness exercises. Users can choose from breathing exercises, reflections, or customized reminders to refocus their attention on their current state and redirect them to do something useful. The breathing exercises pop up once the time limit for using the social media app exceeds, and users can also customize the time limit for each app. With ZenGage, our goal is to promote mindfulness and encourage healthy social media usage habits.

## How we built it
We built ZenGage using JavaFX for the front-end and user interface, Figma for design and prototyping, and Adobe Illustrator for creating graphics and illustrations. Our team utilized a combination of programming languages, including Java and XML, to create a seamless user experience and bring our vision to life.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was figuring out how to incorporate breathing exercises into our app in a way that would be both effective and user-friendly. We also faced some technical challenges in terms of integrating the different tools we used to build the app, but through extensive testing and iteration, we were able to overcome these obstacles and create a seamless user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have developed a mindfulness tracker that is not only effective but also fun and engaging for users. By allowing users to personalize their mindfulness exercises, we believe that ZenGage will be a valuable tool for promoting mindfulness and well-being in the digital age.

## What we learned
Through the development of ZenGage, we learned the importance of user-centered design and the need to constantly test and iterate in order to create the best possible experience for users. We also gained valuable experience in using JavaFX and other programming languages, as well as design tools like Figma and Adobe Illustrator.

## What's next for ZenGage
Moving forward, we are looking to further refine and improve the user experience of ZenGage, and add new features that promote mindfulness and well-being. We also plan to expand our user base and engage with the wider community to gather feedback and ideas for future development.
