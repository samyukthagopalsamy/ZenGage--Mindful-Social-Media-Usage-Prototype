## Inspiration
Our team was inspired by the growing concern around the negative impact of excessive social media usage on our mental health and well-being. We noticed that many current solutions for tracking social media usage simply track the amount of time spent on the platform and send pop notifications after a set amount of time. However, these solutions often fall short, as users may simply snooze or ignore the notifications, and they lack features that promote mindfulness and help users to understand the impact of their social media usage on their well-being.

## What it does
ZenGage is a mindfulness tracker that takes a unique approach to promoting mindfulness in social media usage. The app allows users to personalize their mindfulness practices by offering breathing exercises, reflection prompts, and the ability to set custom reminders. Once the time limit for using a social media app has been exceeded, a breathing exercise will pop up, helping to re-center the user's attention and redirect them to do something useful. Additionally, ZenGage allows users to compare their social media usage habits with their friends, promoting healthy competition and social accountability. The goal is to empower users to make informed decisions about their social media usage and prioritize their well-being.

## How we built it
We built ZenGage using JavaFX for the front-end and user interface, Figma for design and prototyping, and Adobe Illustrator for creating graphics and illustrations. Our team utilized a combination of programming languages, including Java and XML, to create a seamless user experience and bring our vision to life.

## Challenges we ran into
One of the biggest challenges we faced was figuring out how to incorporate breathing exercises into our app in a way that would be both effective and user-friendly. We also faced some technical challenges in terms of integrating the different tools we used to build the app, but through extensive testing and iteration, we were able to overcome these obstacles and create a seamless user experience.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have developed a mindfulness tracker that is not only effective but also fun and engaging for users. By allowing users to personalize their mindfulness exercises, we believe that ZenGage will be a valuable tool for promoting mindfulness and well-being in the digital age.

## What we learned
Through the development of ZenGage, we learned the importance of user-centered design and the need to constantly test and iterate in order to create the best possible experience for users. We also gained valuable experience in using JavaFX and other programming languages, as well as design tools like Figma and Adobe Illustrator.

## What's next for ZenGage
Moving forward, we are looking to further refine and improve the user experience of ZenGage, and add new features that promote mindfulness and well-being. We also plan to expand our user base and engage with the wider community to gather feedback and ideas for future development.
